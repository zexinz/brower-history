Modern web browsers keep track of browsing history which allows users to recall previously visited web pages using the back and forward arrow buttons. When a user navigates back to a previous web page, they also have the option to navigate forward in the navigation history using the forward arrow button. However, if the user navigates back to a previous page and then visits a new web page, all web pages that previously could be accessed with the forward arrow button are discarded. This behavior is well suited for Linked Lists. In this project you will write C++ code to model this behavior.
